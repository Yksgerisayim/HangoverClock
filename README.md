For basic information please read the [Project README](https://github.com/programminghoch10/HangoverClock)

## Wear Edition

This branch contains a prototype wear version of HangoverClock.

[Download latest dev APK](https://github.com/programminghoch10/HangoverClock/raw/weardev/app/release/app-release.apk)

Because of slight problems, the settings are fixed and not adjustable:
* Font: random every redraw
* Date: enabled
* Seconds: enabled when clock active
* Color: white
* Background color: black
* Time format: 24h
* Overhangs:
  * Minutes: 60
  * Hours: 1
  * Seconds: 0
  * Days: 0
  * Months: 0

I'll continue developing a watchface and it will ship with the main app as soon as its ready.
